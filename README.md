RaspPi-Resolution
=================

A command line Python program to alter the resolution of the Raspberry Pi. Can be used to change the resolution and overscan settings.

Why?
====

When you first boot up the Pi it's unlikely to be in the resolution you want. Changing it requires manually editing the config file and rebooting, which is a pain, particularly if you don't get it right first time. This program aims to simplify the process.
